            TODOs, ideas, and other general development notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


TODO List ---------------------------------------------------------------

--- Bugs ---
- Gfx doesn't update after being converted
- No handling for when a line is moved to overlap another
- Map editor should use PLAYPAL from resource chain on 'existing/global'
- 3d mode textures need to update with MapTextureManager, somehow


--- Map Editor ---
- Checks:
	- Missing textures
	- Specials with 0 tag that require a tag
	- Invalid sector references (maybe not, shouldn't really happen)
- Non-power-of-two textures (where simply expanding the texture canvas to 128x128 won't work)
	- Will probably have to implement some kind of resize for this (perhaps FreeImage can do it nicely?)
- 3d mode
	- Auto-align Y
	- Thing z height editing
	- Offsets/scaling copy+paste
	- Flat offset/scale editing (udmf+zdoom)
	- Better vis checking
	- (Z)MAPINFO parsing for sky texture
	- Thing boxes (might not bother with full boxes unless I add game-accurate 'height' property to thing configurations)
	- Preferences dialog page
- Editing:
	- Proper UDMF/Hexen/Doom64 Map saving (BEHAVIOR, SCRIPTS, DIALOGUE, LIGHTS, MACROS, etc.)
	- Generalised sector and line specials
	- Rotate/scale objects ('edit' mode similar to db2 would be nice, perhaps not a mode though)
	- Light increments should probably be defined in game configs (8 for zdoom, 16 for others)
	- Copy+paste sectors/lines
- Script editor
- Better UDMF property handling, proper support for unknown properties read with the map
- (Possibly) better line/thing flag handling
- 'Tag edit' mode
- Optimise Polygon2D splitting somehow, it creates many unneeded splits


--- Minor Problems/Annoyances ---
- Long calltips can extend off the edge of the screen
- Incorrect ctrl+tab behaviour with tabs

--- Editor Features ---
- Generic entry data view (for VERTEXES, LINEDEFS, SIDEDEFS, SECTORS, THINGS, DEMO*, TEXTUREX/PNAMES, ...)
- ANSI screen editor
- Proper font viewer
- 'Cleanup' stuff (unused patches, textures, flats, unneeded entries...)
- Compilation of other language scripts
- Archive merging
- Archive conversion
- 'Export As' for archives (or just ability to select a different type/extension on save as)
- 'Export As' for entries - does conversion+export

--- Formats ---
- 7z
- Lzma/bz2 for zip

--- Text Editor ---
- 'Tabs as Spaces' option

--- Gfx Editor ---
- Basic pixel-drawing tools

--- Audio ---

--- General ---
- Preferences Dialog:
	- List of entry types, ability to enable/disable detection of certain types
- Finish entry data format (EDF_*) system:
	- Simple user-definable data formats:
		- Minimum/maximum size
		- Byte pattern to look for at a certain offset in the file (ideally allow multiple of these), something like:
		  pattern = 10, 255, 255, 255, 0; = look for 255,255,255,0 at offset 10 in file
		- Call inbuilt tests for more complex detection algorithms (wad files, doom gfx, etc)
- General optimisation:
	- Entry type detection (maybe move the initial detection to a background thread)
	- Gfx conversion
- *Resources system:
	- opened archives are either used as resources or not
	- when searching for patches etc, resource archives are searched, then base resource archive
	- archive list on archive manager panel could have 'resource' checkboxes for each list item
- Undo/Redo system
	- Should be general enough to be used by the map editor also
- Different icon sets
- Better backup system
- More drag-and-drop support
- Rewrite VirtualListView with item filtering/sorting in mind


--- Internal / Dev ---
- SFont class
- Ability to set an archive never to read entry data into memory (read data from the file every time)
- MemChunk subclass that deals with a file rather than a memory block
- Some lump (sub)formats can only be identified properly from the presence of other lumps; e.g. GL nodes and THINGS/LINEDEFS
- Needs some kind of proper archive type system, handled by ArchiveManager (similar to SIFormat)
- Need to do something about keeping ArchiveEntry.data.size and ArchiveEntry.size in sync
  (Still need the size member for entries that don't have their data loaded into memory yet)
  (could make ArchiveEntry a subclass of MemChunk?)
- Better way to get the currently selected entries would be nice
- Should probably write my own lexer for TextEditor since the default cpp/cppnocase ones are somewhat limited
- Implement custom replacement for wxFileName that allows fast matching against name/extension etc
- Multithreaded entry type detection?



Changes since 3.0.2 -----------------------------------------------------
To keep track of resource editor changes (in case I decide to release a 3.0.3 after all)

- Added ability to open maps with Doom Builder 2 (if it is installed)
- Added ability to export a texture to a single graphic entry
- Added console commands to list/set cvars
- Gfx offsets are preserved on import
- Added palette editing functionality
- If alt is held down when moving a patch with the arrow keys, a duplicate patch will be added and moved'
- Added ability to quickly jump to items in the patch browser by typing the first few letters of the patch name
- Added word wrapping checkbox to text entry panel
- Keybinds are now configurable in the preferences dialog
- Added colour configuration to preferences dialog
- In the gfx conversion dialog, the transparent colour can now be set by left-clicking on the current preview image
- Multiple entry name filters can now be entered (separated by commas) eg: "MAP01, MAP02"
- Implemented basic 'remove unused textures' and 'remove unused patches' actions
- Added mp3 and module playback
- Changed the browser to use a proper font for item names
- Browser background changed to the checkered texture used in most other gfx views (optional)
- Added 'zoom' slider to the browser window
- Removed the maps list from the open archives tab on the archive manager
- Merged the Archives and Recent Files tabs into one
- Implemented a custom toolbar, replacing the ugly wxAUI ones
- Added ability to directly generate new PLAYPAL, ANIMATED and SWITCHES lumps instead of having to create an empty lump and then import content in it
- Implemented notebook tab art class from CodeLite, now tabs look a fair bit nicer, especially in linux
- New maintenance option: cleaning out entries that are identical duplicates of an IWAD lump
- Texture editor: implemented support for "UseOffsets" property
- Added "Edit Level Script" button to MapEntryPanel and FraggleScript language
- Added playback of Wolfenstein digitized sounds (VSWAP)
- Added new maintenance option: check for duplicated entry content with a CRC-32 check for each entry
- 'Replace In Maps' stuff
- Added COLORMAP lump generation
- Various additions and improvements to texture editor for ZDoom TEXTURES format
- Added option to colour entry list item background by entry type



Unimplemented Feature Requests ------------------------------------------

--- General / User Interface ---
- Fully customisable toolbars
- Sorting by column (I.E. Name or Type)

--- Archive / Entry Management ---
- mass export to format (XWE)
- sorting lumps in archive (not just their display)

--- Entry Editing ---
- SBARINFO viewer/editor

--- Gfx ---
- Save offset type between sessions
Translation dialog:
- Source/destination palette selectable
- Scroll through multiple preview gfx
- Allow use with truecolour gfx
- Tool for trimming blank space around a graphic.
- Tool for adding blank space to either side as needed to put the x offset right in the center (better for mirrored sprites).

Conversion dialog:
- Enter and esc mapped to convert all and skip all

--- Text Editor ---

--- TEXTUREx Editor ---
- list textures and patches in alphabetical order (with non-iwad ones at the bottom of the list)
- find/replace for patches
- Ability to search for a texture containing a specific patch

--- General ---
- Support for LZMA, Bzip2 and zip formats other than store and deflate
- Mass research & replace of map elements (thing numbers, texture or flat names) across a map or all the maps of an archive
	- Mostly done, still needs UDMF implementation and a solid UI for selecting maps to change, what to replace, and with what.



Ideas / Possible Features -----------------------------------------------

- Tree view for entry list (optional)
- Ability to perform all archive/entry management functions via the console (possibly allow scripts too?)
- 'Animation viewer' (select a bunch of sprites to test an animation or whatever)
- Hex editor
- Font editor
- Better UI for palette editing tools (something like the color remap maybe?)
- UI for creating custom colormaps (with other settings than dcolors.c's)
- Merge "Tint" and "Colourize" into a versatile image recolour feature with RGB, HSL, and Lab tweak options as well.
- *Project system:
	- Hide/abstract underlying archive/entry stuff
	- Will need to specify a 'game' for the project to enable/disable certain features:
		- Changes the way certain things are handled (ie vanilla will have separate textures/flats where zdoom will have just textures)
		- Limits resource formats to what is supported (PNG in zdoom but not vanilla)
	- Work with 'resources' rather than entries
	- Resources imported from archives
	- Resource types:
		- Graphics:
			- Textures
			- Flats (for games that don't support mixing of flats/textures only)
			- Sprites
		- Maps
		- Audio:
			- Sounds
			- Music
		- etc...
		- Data (anything that doesn't fit into the above categories)
	- Resources can either be internal or external:
		- Internal means the resource is imported into the project and exported with it
		- External means the resource exists in an external archive and will not be exported with the project
		  (for resources in an IWAD, texture pack, etc)
	- Ability to export project to archive(s):
		- Can export all resources to a single archive
		- Can 'split' resources to separate archives (ie one for textures, another for maps, etc)
	- A system of cascading configurations will be needed to handle all the game/port/format combinations
- Archive/Entry information database:
	- Store within the archive or in a separate file (optional)
	- Menu item 'Archive->Write Metadata'
	- Keeps information about archive entries:
		- CRC (will be used to determine if the info is up-to-date)
		- Extra properties
		- Entry type
- Model viewer
- The 'findModifiedEntries()' function could be used to create an 'Export Changes in New File' feature as an alternative to saving the archive, useful especially for IWADs.
- EntryPanels able to handle multiple entries for special purposes
	- GfxEntryPanel: shows all selected images in a browser kind of thing
	- AudioEntryPanel: loads all selected entries as a playlist
- Full DECORATE editor (would go nicely with the project system above)
- DeHackEd editor (could be an outgrowth of the DECORATE editor since it'd require actor/state management)
- Feature to dump map information (number of vertices (+ nodebuilder vertices), of linedefs, of sidedefs, of sectors, of segs, of things)
	- Report on flats and textures used (which ones, and how many times)
	- Report on thing placement (using game configuration to name and categorize things)
	- Report specials used in map (both linedefs and, if appropriate, things, using game config to name and categorize specials)
	- Ideally would allow to output in a wiki syntax to help make the tables used in the Doom Wiki.
- Waiting For SladeScript(tm), in four steps:
	- Console commands to perform archive management actions (opening or creating archives, saving, importing files, exporting entries, copying, renaming, etc.)
	- Console commands aliases (like in ZDoom)
	- Console command batches (run all commands contained in a file or a lump)
	- Script mode: command-line options to (1) run a console command batch at startup and optionally also (2) quit once the batch is finished.
		- Bonus fifth step: interpret DeuTex scripts, allowing SLADE to replace that outdated tool in projects like Hacx and Freedoom.
