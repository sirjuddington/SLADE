SLADE3 SVN UNIX COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------
1)
Download the required libraries (most should be available in your distro's package repository):
-wxWidgets *2.9+* from <http://wxwidgets.org> (most repositories don't currently have 2.9)
-FreeImage from <http://freeimage.sourceforge.net>
-FluidSynth from <http://fluidsynth.org>
-SFML from <http://sfml-dev.org>

2)
Compile/install the required libraries if needed.

a) wxWidgets:
-Extract the wxWidgets tar
-Follow the instructions in docs/gtk/install.txt ('the simplest case'), but add '--with-opengl --enable-mediactrl' to the ../configure line
-If the above fails and says gstreamer not found, you need to install the gstreamer, gstreamer-plugins and gconf2 dev packages

b) FreeImage:
-Extract the FreeImage tar
-Follow the instructions in README.linux (to install normal FreeImage, not FreeImagePlus)

3)
To compile SLADE3, there are two ways to go about it: either install CodeLite IDE and use that, or build it using CMake

a) IDE Compilation
-Download and install CodeLite IDE from <http://codelite.org>
-Run CodeLite
-Select Workspace->Switch to workspace... and select 'SLADE.workspace' in the trunk directory of the SLADE SVN
-Select Release configuration from the drop-down box on the workspace view if it isn't already selected
-Click the 'Build Active Project' button on the toolbar

b) CMake Compilation
-Make sure cmake is installed <http://cmake.org>
-cd to the 'dist' directory
-Enter the following commands: 'cmake ..' then 'make'

And that should be it. There are some more detailed instructions on the SLADE wiki here: http://slade-editor.wikia.com/wiki/Compilation

OTHER SLADE3 UNIX ISSUES
------------------------
Ubuntu 11.04:
wxWidgets 2.9.1 has some issues with Ubuntu 11.04. These are fixed in wxWidgets 2.9.2 on the wx SVN. Instructions
for checking out the wxWidgets svn can be found here: <http://www.wxwidgets.org/develop/svn.htm>. The compilation
instructions for 2.9.1 above also apply for 2.9.2.
