Documentation for SLADE Lua scripting types and functions.

!!! Warning
    This is all very WIP, expect changes before 3.1.2 is released

## Notes

* All type properties are read-only unless otherwise specified
* State is not presereved after running a script - eg. a global variable defined in a script will not be available next time a script is run
